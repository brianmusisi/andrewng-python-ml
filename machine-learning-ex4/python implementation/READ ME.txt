The file neural_net.py contains an implementation of a neural network algorithm written in python

The algorithm has been optimized for the digits dataset, in the same folder. Each row in the X portion 
of the dataset corresponds to a particular digit. The digit it corresponds to is also provided in the corresponding
y column.

The neural net is used to learn and later predict the number in an image based on the pixel intensities at different values.

The file use_neural_net.py loads the data from  the digits dataset, splits it into train and test data,
trains the model using the training data and then predicts the number based on the pixel values only
in the test data. The accuracy is then calculated and printed

Text versions of the two python files are also included.
