# Python Solutions to Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course

This repo contains solutions to Andrew Ng's popular Machine Learning course from Coursera written both in Octave as well as pPython

Each folder corresponds to one of the 8 exercises in the course. Each folder consists:
* Folder with Original Octave code
* PDF with the exercise instructions
* Python implementation of the exercises

As would be expected, the last folder contains the python implementation of the solution to the exercise.
